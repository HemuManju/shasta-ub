# SHaSTA (Simulator for Human and Swarm Team Applications)

![Simulator Banner](docs/images/cessna.png)
*(Screenshot for illustration purposes only.)*

Welcome to the SHaSTA! An open-source simulation platform to study human-swarm applications. The platform provides a unified interface for humans and learning algorithms to command/learn swarm robot behaviors. SHaSTA also provides a unique ability to collect physiological information from humans and time synchronize it with swarm simulation.
